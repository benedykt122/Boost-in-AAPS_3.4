/**
 * Sustained low-step aerobic work: long rides, rowing, paddling (2026-09-28, Boost-endurance).
 *
 * The step-based activity path cannot see cycling, which produces almost no steps, and the heart-rate
 * path classifies one cycle at a time, so a ride flickers between RESISTANCE (zone 3 to 4), RESTING
 * (zone 2, then the inactivity branch) and back as the rider climbs, descends and stops. Each flicker
 * ends an exercise bout. This detector holds one state across the whole effort instead.
 *
 * A cycle qualifies when heart rate is in zone 2 or above (HRR >= 30%) and fewer than
 * [LOW_STEPS_15MIN] steps landed in the last 15 minutes. Endurance begins once qualifying cycles have
 * run for [ENTRY_MIN] minutes, a gap of up to [DIP_TOLERANCE_MIN] not resetting the clock, and ends
 * only after [EXIT_MIN] continuous minutes without a qualifying cycle, so a descent or a short stop
 * does not end the ride. Missing heart rate does not qualify, so a watch that goes dark ends the
 * state after [EXIT_MIN]. Time-based throughout, so it behaves the same at any loop cadence.
 *
 * Known overlap: a weights session with steady heart rate and little walking can qualify after 30
 * minutes and receive the endurance profile reduction, where resistance guidance keeps the profile.
